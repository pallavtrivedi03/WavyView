WavyView is a library written in swift for creating animations like wave.

# Installing
WavyView is available on Cocoapods and can be easily installed from there by mentioning below line in your pod file

pod 'WavyView', '~> 1.0'

pod install

That's all.


# How to use
1. To get the wavy animations, just subclass your view (in which you wish to put the animations) with WavyView.
2. While implementing through Interface Builder, just change the class of view from UIView to WavyView. As a confirmation, you can check the attribute inspector tab, which would have configuration options like Amplitude, WaveDirection etc.


# Features
1. Wavy animation by just subclassing a UIView.
2. Completely configurable through interface builder.
3. Controls to change wave colors, amplitude, speed, direction, duration.
